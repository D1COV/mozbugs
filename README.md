# mozbugs

The aim of mozbugs is to help new Mozilla contributors find the best place to start among the many bugs that are recommended for newbies. With the use of filtering, users will be able to find the right bug for them to work on.

The project was started as an assignment for the Open-Source Development module at [Coventry University](http://www.coventry.ac.uk), and was inspired by [Bugs Ahoy!](https://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/)
